# Data Files

* Data files are files formatted & put into template variables so your templates know they exist.
* Mostly these are _posts, _drafts, (& _slides, _?)
* **underscore** matters, name can matter (posts feed date), front-matter overrides:

```
_posts/2011-12-31-some-post.md
_posts/2012-09-12-another-post.md
```
